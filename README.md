## Reflections

### Shooting

**Question:** A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible reasons for the man not dying.

**Reasons:**
- She didn't hit the man
- She fired a blank shot
- She didn't hit a vital part of the man (finger, foot, etc...)
- The man was rushed to surgery before dying of blood loss
- The man was wearing a bulletproof vest
- The man had some kind of metal or thick items in a pocket that took the hit
- The pistol backfired

### Alien

**Question:** An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can.

**Steps:**
1. Take the toothpaste with your second hand
2. With your preferred hand turn the cap of the toothpaste anti-clockwise
3. Put the cap down on the table
4. Take the toothbrush with your preferred hand
5. Make sure the toothbrush's front is turning up and backside down
6. Make sure the toothpaste's head is just above the lower part of the toothbrush's head
7. Gentle squeeze the toothpaste, depends on how much toothpaste there is left
8. When the toothpaste is squeezed out of the container slowly, in the same speed, move your arm that holds the toothpaste towards the upper part of the toothbrush's head
9. Stop squeezing when you reach the end of the toothbrush
10. Put down the toothpaste on the table
11. Open your mouth
12. Put the toothbrush inside your mouth
13. Close your libs together
14. Starting with your left-sided lower teeth, turn the toothbrush head towards your teeth and start brushing in circular motion for about ten seconds
15. Then move to the next set of teeth
16. repeat this until all of your teeth has been brushes on all sides
17. Take the toothbrush out of your mouth and split out the toothpaste
18. Rinse your mouth and toothbrush with water
19. Put down the toothbrush
20. Take up the toothpaste with your second hand
21. Take up the toothpaste's cap with your preferred hand
22. Put the cap on the toothpaste and turn clockwise
23. Put down the toothpaste
24. Give the world a big smile with your shiny teeth!

## Two katas

Complete the following two katas using TDD. Make sure to follow the TDD mantra, “red-green-refactor”:
- Red: Write a failing test.
- Green: Write the smallest implementation to make your test pass.
- Refactor: Make the necessary refactoring to the implementation and tests, in order to remove code redundancy

A fuller explanation of the TDD steps can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development

### Fahrenheit-to-celcius converter

1. Use TDD to create a fahrenheit-to-celcius converter.
2. Use TDD to extend it to a celcius-to-fahrenheit converter.

### Roman numeral kata

Implement an “Arabic numeral to roman numeral” converter using TDD. Follow the standard form of roman numerals – the rules can be found on the wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Standard_form

You can test your converter against this online converter: http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html

## Give your thoughts on TDD

**What was positive and good about using TDD?**

As a developer you are certain the test is created and that they make sense. 

**What was annoying or difficult?**

Creating test before the code is created. Create stupid/bad code to refactor it a million times after each new test.

**What surprised you?**

How stupid I feel when doing TDD correctly.

**Did TDD help you write some tests you would not otherwise have thought of?**

No, since what TDD helps developers to do is just part of my development rhythm.
